## FinTech outcomes that scale
- Published industry-to-industry payment flows with the UK Office for National Statistics to forecast economic shocks and supply chain shifts.
- Classified 15m+ accounts per month (business vs personal) with XGBoost; pipelines tuned to crunch billions of FPS/Bacs/ICS transactions.
- Evaluated fraud-data providers with PCA/cluster analysis to quantify signal lift and early detection value.
- Built Open Banking payment-category mapping plus a Wrapped-style module; >80% satisfaction in A/B tests.
- Delivered an exec "60-second" DOMO dashboard that cut crisis response times by up to 75% and corrected GBP 3m/year in financials.
- Reworked the grad scheme into 1x9 + 2x4.5 month stints across International Payment Strategy/Portfolio/Project Management, Open Banking, UK Faster Payments, Financial Crime, and the Mastercard Economics Institute to learn the stack end-to-end.

## Research & academic threads
- **MPhil Machine Learning & AI with Physics, University of Cambridge** - focusing on deep learning, HPC, and medical imaging; research on CNN-based satellite trail removal for astronomical images.
- **BSc Physics, University of Bath (First Class)** - projects across astrophysics (exoplanet notebook + visualisations), numerical methods in C/MATLAB/Python, and lab work on instrumentation/analysis.
- **Coursework builds** - detector calibration with likelihood/bootstraps, a 5D interpolation platform (FastAPI + TensorFlow/NumPy + Next.js), and a handwritten digit suite with Optuna tuning and triplet embeddings.
- Awarded Mastercard sponsorship + sabbatical to pursue advanced study; keen on where physics-style modelling meets real-world ML.

## Ways to work together
- **Advisory sprints:** assess data/ML roadmaps, vendor evaluations, and architecture choices with concrete next steps.
- **Build &amp; handoff:** ship the first version (model + API + UI) with clean docs/tests, then upskill your team.
- **Fractional DS/ML:** part-time engagements to maintain, monitor, and iterate on live models and analytics.
- **Mentorship:** career and academic coaching for analysts/engineers looking to level up or apply for advanced study.
