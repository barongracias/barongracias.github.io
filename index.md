## Ways to work together
- **AI advisory sprints:** tighten roadmaps, vendor picks, and architecture with clear next steps.
- **Build &amp; handoff:** ship the first version (model + API + UI) with tests/docs, then upskill your team.
- **Fractional DS/ML:** part-time ownership to maintain and iterate on live models/analytics.
- **Mentorship (separate):** one-on-one career/academic coaching - see the [mentorship page](/mentorship/) for details.
