## FinTech outcomes that scale
- Published industry-to-industry payment flows with the UK Office for National Statistics to forecast economic shocks and supply chain shifts.
- Classified 15m+ accounts per month (business vs personal) with XGBoost; pipelines tuned to crunch billions of FPS/Bacs/ICS transactions.
- Evaluated fraud-data providers with PCA/cluster analysis to quantify signal lift and early detection value.
- Built Open Banking payment-category mapping plus a Wrapped-style module; >80% satisfaction in A/B tests.
- Delivered an exec "60-second" DOMO dashboard that cut crisis response times by up to 75% and corrected GBP 3m/year in financials.
- Rotated across International Payment Strategy, Open Banking, UK Faster Payments, Financial Crime, and the Mastercard Economics Institute to learn the stack end-to-end.
- MEI: exploratory analysis on Iceland tourism-driven GDP uplift using OAG flight data to size sector impact.
- Fraud: integrated with Feedzai, building a Spark adapter to convert input schemas into the AutoML pipeline.

## Ways to work together
- **AI advisory sprints:** tighten roadmaps, vendor picks, and architecture with clear next steps.
- **Build &amp; handoff:** ship the first version (model + API + UI) with tests/docs, then upskill your team.
- **Fractional DS/ML:** part-time ownership to maintain and iterate on live models/analytics.
- **Mentorship (separate):** one-on-one career/academic coaching - see the [mentorship page](/mentorship/) for details.
