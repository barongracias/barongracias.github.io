Welcome! I build data products for payments, fraud, and financial insights. I turn messy transaction data into models, dashboards, and decisions that move the needle for stakeholders.

## What I'm focused on
- Senior Data Scientist at Mastercard, specialising in payments and fraud analytics; four years of Python- and SQL-driven delivery.
- Sponsored sabbatical for an MPhil in Machine Learning & AI at the University of Cambridge (2025-2026).
- Trusted to translate complex signal into clear narratives for executives, regulators, and product teams.

## Selected highlights
- Published industry-to-industry payment flows with the UK Office for National Statistics to help forecast economic shocks and supply chain shifts.
- Deployed an XGBoost model classifying 15m accounts per month as business/personal with 85%+ accuracy; tuned execution plans to crunch billions of FPS/Bacs/ICS transactions.
- Led fraud data provider proof-of-value using PCA and cluster analysis to assess feature vector similarity and early detection lift.
- Built Open Banking payment-category mapping and "payment statistics" modules; A/B tests showed 80%+ user satisfaction.
- Shipped a DOMO "60-second" dashboard for leadership; crisis response times dropped by up to 75%.
- Created a resource management tool (99.6% allocation accuracy) that boosted utilisation up to 3x and corrected GBP 3m/year in financials.

## Tools and domains
Python, SQL (Oracle, SSMS, Teradata), Spark, PyTorch, scikit-learn, OpenCV, HPC/parallelisation, classification, NLP, PCA, A/B testing, PowerBI, DOMO, Tableau, Git, Docker, CI/CD.

## Certifications
Stanford Machine Learning Specialization (2024), IBM Data Science Specialization (2024).

## Outside of work
Founder and Director of Sports at Mastercard: led corporate football teams, raised GBP 20k for charity, and organised events including a Women in Tech tournament and trips to the FIFCO World Cups.
