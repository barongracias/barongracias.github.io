I'm a senior data scientist who ships AI, analytics, and ML products for payments, fraud, and product teams. I pair a University of Cambridge MPhil in Machine Learning & AI for Physics with hands-on delivery at Mastercard, turning messy data into decisions leadership can act on. The goal: models, dashboards, and playbooks that hold up in regulated environments and stay explainable.

## Career snapshots
