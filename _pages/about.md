I'm a senior data scientist who ships ML and analytics for payments, fraud, and product teams. I like turning messy data into decisions leadership can act on, and building tools that survive real-world constraints. I reworked my Mastercard grad scheme to get broader exposure: instead of 2x9-month rotations, I pushed for 1x9 plus 2x4.5 months across International Payment Strategy/Portfolio/Project Management, Open Banking, UK Faster Payments, Financial Crime, and the Mastercard Economics Institute.
