I help teams turn raw data into revenue, resilience, and clear decisions. Work with me as an AI consultant, a hands-on ML/DS builder, or a fractional partner who keeps models healthy.

## What you get
- Industry-grade delivery from a Senior DS who has shipped ML/analytics in regulated payments and fraud, with governance and auditability in mind.  
- Deep AI skills (PyTorch/TensorFlow, experiment design, HPC-style workloads) backed by an MPhil in ML & AI with Physics at Cambridge.  
- Clear communication, fast iteration, and documentation/runbooks that teams can own after handoff - no black boxes.

**Mentorship (separate track):** one-on-one coaching to break into and thrive at Fortune 500 FinTechs and elite universities (e.g., Cambridge). [See mentorship page](/mentorship/).

## Engagement styles
- **Advisory sprints:** roadmaps, vendor assessments, architecture reviews, and experiment plans with concrete next steps.  
- **Build & handoff:** model + API + UI shipped with tests, observability, and docs; pairing sessions to upskill your team.  
- **Fractional DS/ML:** ongoing ownership of live models/analytics, monitoring, and iteration.  
- **Mentorship (separate):** career and academic coaching for analysts, engineers, and grads aiming for fast progression or advanced study.  

## How engagements work
- **Discovery (free):** 30-45 minutes to align on goals, data reality, and success criteria.
- **Scope + milestones:** written plan with timelines, dependencies, and comms cadence.
- **Build:** transparent updates, demos, and instrumentation from day one.
- **Handoff:** docs, dashboards, and a playbook for your team. Optional ongoing support or fractional ownership.

## Example projects
- Payment flows for the UK Office for National Statistics to forecast economic shocks and supply chain shifts.
- Business vs personal account classifier for 15m+ accounts/month; pipelines tuned for billions of transactions.
- Fraud data provider PoV using PCA/cluster analysis to quantify signal lift and early detection value.
- Open Banking "payment wrapped" experience with categorisation models and user insights; >80% satisfaction in A/B tests.
- Exec "60-second" dashboards and resource management tooling that unlocked GBP 3m/year and cut response times by 75%.
- Rapid prototypes: SFE repayment simulator (Next.js), fog-of-war travel map (MapLibre + H3), weekly video PWA (MediaRecorder + PWA), ML pipelines for stock prediction.

## Mentorship focus
- Career: interview prep, salary benchmarking, how to play the corporate game without burning out, and timing your next move.  
- Performance: framing impact for reviews, building relationships with managers/mentors, and setting goals that stick.  
- Academia: navigating applications for advanced study (e.g., Cambridge MPhil) and balancing work with postgraduate ambitions.  
- Track record: only grad in cohort promoted to Senior DS within 9 months; multiple interns/new grads mentored to return offers; blend of big finance/tech experience and academic perspective.

## Tooling & stack
Python (pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn), SQL (Oracle, SSMS, Teradata), Spark, Plotly, PowerBI/DOMO/Tableau, Next.js/React, Docker, CI/CD. Comfortable in regulated environments and with HPC/parallelisation when data gets heavy.
