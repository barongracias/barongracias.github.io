I'm a Senior Data Scientist from Mastercard and ML/AI specialist from Cambridge University. I help data, product, and risk leaders design AI systems, build robust ML/analytics, and land high-ROI implementations. Work with me as an AI consultant, a hands-on ML/DS builder, a forward-deployed partner, or a fractional owner who keeps models healthy.

## What you get
- Industry-grade delivery from a Senior DS (Mastercard) who has shipped ML/analytics in regulated payments and fraud, with governance and auditability in mind.  
- Deep AI skills (PyTorch/TensorFlow, experiment design, HPC-style workloads) backed by a Cambridge MPhil in ML & AI for Physics.  
- Clear communication, fast iteration, ROI focus, and documentation/runbooks that teams can own after handoff—no black boxes.

- **Mentorship (separate):** career and academic coaching for analysts, engineers, and grads aiming for fast progression or advanced study.  

## How engagements work
- **Discovery (free):** 30-45 minutes to align on goals, data reality, and success criteria.
- **Scope + milestones:** written plan with timelines, dependencies, and comms cadence.
- **Build:** transparent updates, demos, and instrumentation from day one.
- **Handoff:** docs, dashboards, and a playbook for your team. Optional ongoing support or fractional ownership.
