I like building data products that survive the messy realities of payments data: long-tail entities, edge-case references, and the operational constraints of real pipelines. A few representative projects:

### Business vs personal account classifier
- XGBoost model classifying 15m accounts per month with 85%+ accuracy; parallelised pipelines to process billions of FPS/Bacs/ICS transactions.  
- Result: higher confidence in customer segmentation and downstream analytics quality.

### Payment flows with the UK Office for National Statistics
- Published industry-to-industry payment flow insights to help government teams forecast economic shocks and understand UK supply chains.  
- Result: informed policy discussions with granular, near-real-time transaction intelligence.

### Fraud data provider proof-of-value
- Evaluated an external data provider using PCA, distribution analysis, and clustering on superimposed features to measure similarity and early detection lift.  
- Result: clear value-add story for leadership and a roadmap for production integration.

### Open Banking "payment wrapped"
- Payment-category mapping model plus a statistics module to deliver Spotify Wrapped-style insights to users.  
- Result: 80%+ satisfaction in A/B tests and a clearer retention hook for the product.

### Pay.UK NLP and reference hygiene
- Tokenised fuzzy matching to map business names to Companies House with 88% accuracy across 50m accounts; added sentiment/profanity detection on payment references.  
- Result: improved entity resolution and better trust signals for downstream risk models.

### Operational intelligence and resourcing
- Built a DOMO "60-second" dashboard for leadership, cutting crisis response times by up to 75%.  
- Created a resource management tool with 99.6% allocation accuracy, tripling utilisation and correcting GBP 3m/year of financial misstatements.

**Core stack:** Python, SQL (Oracle, SSMS, Teradata), Spark, PyTorch, scikit-learn, OpenCV, HPC/parallelisation, classification, NLP, PCA, A/B testing, PowerBI, DOMO, Tableau, Git, Docker, CI/CD.
