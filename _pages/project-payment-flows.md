Published industry-to-industry payment flow insights with the UK Office for National Statistics to help forecast economic shocks and understand supply chain exposure.

## What I built
- Data model capturing directional payment flows between industries with near-real-time refreshes.  
- Analytical pipeline to quantify shifts and volatility at multiple aggregation levels.  
- Narrative deliverable packaged for government audiences, balancing rigour with clarity.

## Problem
Policymakers needed timely signals on how money moves through UK supply chains to anticipate shocks and support resilience. Traditional surveys were too slow and coarse.

## Approach
1) Joined transaction streams with industry metadata to map counterparties to sectors.  
2) Engineered flow features (volume, value, concentration, change rates) and stability metrics to flag emerging stress.  
3) Built repeatable notebooks and QA checks to ensure defensible, reproducible statistics.  
4) Co-authored the report with ONS stakeholders, translating technical findings into policy-friendly language and visuals.

## Impact
- Delivered granular, timely insights that informed discussions on economic resilience.  
- Established a reusable framework for future industry flow monitoring.

## Stack
Python, pandas, Spark, SQL, PowerBI/Tableau for visual exploration, versioned analysis notebooks.
