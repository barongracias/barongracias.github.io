I offer one-on-one mentorship for analysts, engineers, and grads looking to level up, navigate promotions, or pursue advanced study. Separate from B2B consulting, this track focuses on breaking into and thriving at Fortune 500 FinTechs (e.g., Mastercard) and earning spots at institutions like the University of Cambridge.

## Focus areas
Practical support to land and grow in Fortune 500 FinTech roles and elite academic programs.
- Interviews and salary benchmarks for data/ML roles.  
- Performance narratives and goal setting that resonate with managers.  
- Navigating big finance/tech: when to change teams, how to get promoted quickly, and maintaining work-life balance.  
- Academic pathways: applying for advanced study at elite universities (e.g., Cambridge MPhil), balancing study with work.

## Why me
- Only grad in my cohort to reach Senior Data Scientist in 9 months at a Fortune 500 (Mastercard).  
- Mentored interns/grads at Mastercard who all secured return offers.  
- Experience across multiple teams (payments strategy, Open Banking, Faster Payments, financial crime, economics institute).  
- Admitted to the University of Cambridge MPhil in Machine Learning & AI for Physics and can coach on applying to elite programs.

## How it works
- 30-minute chemistry call to align on goals.  
- Lightweight plan with tangible next steps.  
- Sessions via video; async feedback on CVs, promotions, or study applications as needed.
